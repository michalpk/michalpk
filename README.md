# 👋 Hey, I’m Michal!

🎩 Full-stack developer from Královec, Czech Republic – I love web, AI, and ideas with real drive.  
💻 I enjoy building things with style, function, and a bit of cheek.  
🧠 I experiment with AI, backend, and frontend alike.  
☁️ I host on Cloudflare, my code’s on GitHub (though most projects are private).

## 🎮 SidewayRP (2018–2024)  
[🔗 sideway.cz](https://sideway.cz)

Founder, developer, manager, and visionary.  
A legendary Czech GTA V RP project that raised hundreds of players.  
It wasn’t just an RP server – we built our own systems, intranet, bots, MDT tools, and more.  
A project I put hundreds of hours, hundreds of players, and crazy energy into.

> *“It wasn’t just about RP – it was about building a legend.”*

## 🏰 Královec is Czech  
[🌍 visitkralovec.cz](https://visitkralovec.cz) &#124; [🐦 @KralovecCzechia](https://x.com/KralovecCzechia)

Královec started as a meme.  
I led the project from the very first tweets, set the vibe, and, with the team, launched the site and kicked off an unstoppable avalanche.  
Media, memes, diplomats. Yeah, that really happened.

> *“Královec is Czech. Period.”*

## 💾 How I Use GitHub

GitHub is my backstage, not a shop window.  
My repos are sandboxes – most of my code is private, but every now and then I’ll push something public here.  
If something catches your eye, take it or drop me a line.
